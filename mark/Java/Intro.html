<h1>Graph</h1>

<p>A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent pairwise structure between objects.
</p>

<blockquote><p>A graph $G = (V,E)$ consist of $V$ a non empty set of vertices (or nodes) and $E$ a set of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it called its endpoints. An edge is said to be connected  to its endpoints.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Infinite graph</strong> → A graph with infinite set of vertices and edges.
</p>

<p><strong>Finite graph</strong> → A graph with finite set of vertices and edges.
</p>

<p><strong>Multigraph</strong> → A graph where you are allowed to have more than one edge connecting the same pair of vertices.
</p>

<p><small>Think of it like having multiple different roads (edges) directly connecting the same two towns (vertices).</small>
</p>

<p><strong>Loop</strong> → A loop in a graph is a edge that connects a vertex to itself (sometimes called <u>Self-loop</u>)
</p>

<p><strong>Pseudographs</strong> → A graph which allows both loops and multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices.
</p>

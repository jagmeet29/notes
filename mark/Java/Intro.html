  <h2>Graph</h2>
  
  <p>A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent pairwise structure between objects.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote><p>A graph $G = (V,E)$ consist of $V$ a non empty set of vertices (or nodes) and $E$ a set of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it called its endpoints. An edge is said to be connected  to its endpoints.</p></blockquote>
  
  <p><strong>Infinite graph</strong> → A graph with infinite set of vertices and edges.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Finite graph</strong> → A graph with finite set of vertices and edges.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Multigraph</strong> → A graph where you are allowed to have more than one edge connecting the same pair of vertices.
  </p>
  
  <small>Think of it like having multiple different roads (edges) directly connecting the same two towns (vertices).</small>
  
  <p><strong>Loop</strong> → A loop in a graph is a edge that connects a vertex to itself (sometimes called <u>Self-loop</u>)
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Pseudographs</strong> → A graph which allows both loops and multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices.
  </p><small>In contract ot simple graph which allow one edges between two vertices and no loops.</small>
  
  <h2>Directed Graph</h2>
  
  <blockquote><p>A directed graph, or digraph, is a structure that not only shows connections between objects (vertices) but also captures the direction of those connections. In a directed graph, the structure is formally defined as a pair $(V,E)$, where $V$ is a nonempty set of vertices and $E$ is a set of directed edges (or arcs).</p></blockquote>
  
  <p><strong>Simple directed graph</strong> → A directed graph having no loops and multiple directed edges.

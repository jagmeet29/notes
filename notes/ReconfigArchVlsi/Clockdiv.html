    <h1>Clock Divider</h1>

    <blockquote>Clock dividers are circuits that divide the frequency of a clock signal by a certain factor. They are commonly used in digital systems to generate lower frequency clock signals from a higher frequency source.</blockquote>

    <h3>Example: 2-bit Clock Divider</h3>
    <p>We will design a 2-bit clock divider that divides the input clock frequency by 4. The output will toggle every 4 clock cycles.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-verilog">
module clock_divider (
    input clk_in,
    output reg clk_out
);    
reg [1:0] counter; // 2-bit counter   
always @(posedge clk_in) begin
    counter <= counter + 1; // Increment the counter on each clock cycle
    clk_out <= counter[1]; // Output the MSB of the counter as the divided clock
    end
endmodule</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the counter is a 2-bit register that increments on each rising edge of the input clock. The output clock (clk_out) is generated by taking the most significant bit (MSB) of the counter.</p>
<h3>Example: 32-bit Clock Divider </h3>
<p>We will design a 32-bit clock divider that divides the input clock frequency by 26. We use the 25 th bit of the counter register.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-verilog">
module clockdivide(clk, nclk);
input clk;
output reg nclk;
reg [31:0]count=32'd0;
always@(posedge clk) begin
    count=count+1;
    nclk=count[25];
    end
endmodule
    </code></pre>
    <p>A 32-bit counter register count is initialized to zero. On every positive edge of the input clock, the counter is incremented by 1.The output clock (<code>nclk</code>) is assigned the value of the 26th bit (bit 25) of the counter.</p>
    <h4></h4>
    <p>Since the code uses bit 25 of the counter, the division ratio is 2^26 (67,108,864). This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the input clock is 100 MHz, the output clock would be approximately 1.49 Hz.</li>

<li>Each bit position in the counter creates a clock with half the frequency of the previous bit.</li>

<li>The counter works as a frequency divider by 2^n, where n is the bit position.</li>
</ul>

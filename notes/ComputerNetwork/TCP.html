    <h1>TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol )</h1>
    <blockquote>TCP operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked communication service between applications running on different hosts connected via an IP network</blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Like UDP, TCP uses port numbers as transport layer Address.
        </li>
        <li>If an application can use both UDP and TCP, the same port number is assigned to this application.
        </li>
        <li>TCP is described as a stream-oriented protocol, it means that it treats the data being sent between two applications as a continuous, ordered sequence of bytes (or octets), rather than as a series of distinct messages or packets.</li>
        <li>TCP creates an environment in which the two processes seem to be connected by an imaginary “tube” that carries their data across the Internet.  
        </li></ul>

        <li>Buffers are needed for storage, because the sending and receiving processes may not produce and consume data at the same speed.</li><li>
            There are to buffers, one for each direction</li>
            <li>One way to implement a buffer is to use a circular array of 1-Byte locations, as shown</li>
            <li>Normally the buffers are hundreds or thousands of Bytes, depending on the implementation.
            </li>

    <ul><h6>Sender Side Buffer:</h6>
        <li>At sending side, the buffer has three types of locations:

            <li>The white section contains empty locations that can be filled by the sending process (producer).</li><li>
            The grey area holds Bytes that have been sent but not yet acknowledged. (TCP keeps the Bytes in the buffer until it receives an acknowledgement).</li><li>
            The colored area are Bytes to be send by sending TCP.</li><li>
            
            However, TCP may be able to send only part of this colored section, due to the slowness of the receiving process or congestion in the network.</li><li>
            The circular shape is due to the fact that after Bytes in the grey locations are acknowledged, the location is recycled and available for use by sending process.
            </li>
            <h6>Receiver Side Buffer:</h6>
            <li>The operation of the buffer at the receiver site is simpler.</li><li>
                The circular buffer is divided into two areas (white and colored).</li><li>
                
                The white area contains empty locations to be filled by Bytes received from the network.</li><li>
                The colored sections contain received Bytes that can be consumed by receiving process.</li><li>
                
                When a Byte is consumed by the receiving process, the location is recycled and added to the pool of empty locations.
                </li>
    </ul>

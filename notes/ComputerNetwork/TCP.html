    <h1>TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol )</h1>
    <blockquote>TCP operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked communication service between applications running on different hosts connected via an IP network</blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Like UDP, TCP uses port numbers as transport layer Address.
        </li>
        <li>If an application can use both UDP and TCP, the same port number is assigned to this application.
        </li>
        <li>TCP is described as a stream-oriented protocol, it means that it treats the data being sent between two applications as a continuous, ordered sequence of bytes (or octets), rather than as a series of distinct messages or packets.</li>
        <li>TCP creates an environment in which the two processes seem to be connected by an imaginary “tube” that carries their data across the Internet.  
        </li></ul>

        <li>Buffers are needed for storage, because the sending and receiving processes may not produce and consume data at the same speed.</li><li>
            There are to buffers, one for each direction</li>

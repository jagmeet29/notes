    <h1>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</h1>
    <blockquote>UDP is a connectionless, unreliable protocol that has no flow and error control. It uses port numbers to multiplex data from the application layer.
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>UDP is a simple, connectionless and unreliable transport-layer protocol.</li>
        <li>
            It does not add anything to the services of IP except for providing process-to-process communication. </li>
            <li>
            UDP performs a very limited error checking.</li>
            <li>
                UDP packets are called <em>Datagrams</em> and have fixed size header of 8 Bytes.
            </li>
            <li>In UDP a process (an application program) sends a chunk of bytes to UDP for delivery.</li><li>
                UDP adds its own header to this chunk of data, which is then called a user datagram, and delivers it to IP for transmission.</li><li>
                The process may deliver several chunks of data to UDP, but UDP treats each chunk independently without seeing any connection between them.
                </li>
            <li>It is not usually used for process that needs to send bulk data, such as FTP.
            </li>
            <li>The trivial File Transport Protocol (TFTP) includes flow and error control.
            </li>
            <li>Multicasting capabilities are embedded in the UDP software but not in TCP software.</li><li>UDP is used for some route update protocols such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP).</li><li>
                UDP is used in conjunction with Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) to provide a transport-layer mechanism for real-time data.

            If the UDP is so powerless why would a process wants to use it?
            
            UDP is a very simple protocol with a minimum of overhead.
            If a process wants to send a small message and does not care much about reliability, it can use UDP.
            It takes much less interaction between sender and receiver.
            UDP is also a convenient protocol for multimedia and multicasting applications.
            
            UDP uses port numbers are the addressing mechanism in the transport layer.

    </div><h6 >TFTP</h6>
    <p>Â TFTP, or Trivial File Transfer Protocol, is a simple high-level protocol for transferring data servers use to boot diskless workstations, X-terminals, and routers by using User Data Protocol (UDP).
    </p>
    <h6>RTP</h6>
    <p>The Real-time Transport Protocol is a network protocol used to deliver streaming audio and video media over the internet, thereby enabling the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

    <h2>Datagrams</h2>
    <div class="res-container"><img src="10.png" width="500px"></div>
    
<br> <ul>
    <li>
        <b>Source Port Number:</b><br>
        16-bit long field containing the port number used by the process running on the source. (value can be from 0 to 65,535).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Destination Port Number:</b><br>
        16-bits field containing the port number of the process running on the destination.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Length:</b><br>
        16-bit field defines the total length of the user datagram (Header + Data).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Checksum:</b><br>
        Used to detect errors (checksum) over entire datagram. (Header + Data).<br>
        Although UDP checksum should be based on the UDP header and payload (data coming from the application layer), but the designers have also added a part of IP header (only those fields not changing by the routers).<br>
        This ensures that those fields have not been changed from source to destination.<br>
        The calculation of the checksum and its inclusion in a user datagram is optional.<br>
        If the checksum is not calculated this field is filled with 0s.
    </li>
</ul>

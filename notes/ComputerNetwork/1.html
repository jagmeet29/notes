        <h2>Types of Delivery</h2>
        <h3>Node to Node Delivery</h3>
        <blockquote>Delivery of frames between two neighboring nodes over a link by data-link layer.
        </blockquote>
<h3>Host to Host Delivery</h3>
<blockquote>
Delivery of data-grams between two hosts by  network layer.
</blockquote>



But communication on Internet is not defined as the exchanged of data between two nodes or between two hosts…
Real communication takes place between two processes (application programs).<br><br>
But at a single time many processes are running at source and destination.<br><br>
A mechanism is required to deliver data from one of these processes running on the source host to the corresponding process running on the destination host.

<h3>Process to Process Delivery</h3>
<blockquote> transport layer is responsible for process-to-process delivery.</blockquote>
<h3>Client Server Paradigm</h3>

<blockquote>The client-server paradigm is a common model used in computer networks and distributed applications where two types of processes communicate: a client and a server.</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Client:</b> A process (program) running on a local computer that requests a service or resource.
<br><br>
<b>Server:</b> A process running on a remote (or sometimes the same) computer that provides the requested service or resource.

<p class="note"> Note that both the process have the same name.</p>

<b>Request-Response Pattern:</b> The client initiates communication by sending a request to the server. The server waits for such requests and responds by providing the requested service or data. This interaction follows a request-response pattern.
<br><br>
<b>How It Works:</b> The client process sends a request to the server process, typically over a network. The server process receives the request, processes it, and sends back a response. The client receives the response and uses the data or service accordingly.
<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> For example, when you use a web browser (client) to access a website, your browser sends a request to the web server. The server processes this request and sends back the webpage to your browser.
   
<h4 >
    For communication we must define the following:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Local host.</li>
<li>Local process.</li> 
<li>Remote host.</li>
<li>Remote process.</li>
</ul>

Operating systems today support both multi-user and multi-programming environments. A server and client both can run several programs at the same time.
</p>

<h2>Addressing</h2>
<blockquote>Addressing in computer networks, especially at the transport layer, is the method used to deliver data from one specific process on a host to another specific process on a different host.</blockquote>

<b>
It involves two key identifiers at each end of the communication:</b>
<ol>

<li>IP Address</li>
<li>Port Number</li>
</ol>
 
<b>IP Address</b>
<blockquote>Identifies the host (computer or device) uniquely on the network.</blockquote>
<p>Used by the network layer to deliver packets from one host to another.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b>
 192.168.1.1
</p>
<p>
<b>Port Number</b>
<blockquote>Identifies the specific process (application or service) running on the host.</blockquote>
<p>Used by the transport layer to distinguish among multiple processes running on the same host.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b> 80 (for HTTP), 443 (for HTTPS), 25 (for SMTP)</p>
<p>In the Internet model, the port numbers are 16-bit integers between 0 and 65,535.
</p>
<p>Port numbers allow multiplexing and demultiplexing of data to/from applications.</p>
</p>
<h3>
   IP Address + Port Number =  Socket Address
</h3>
<blockquote>To uniquely identify a process on a host, we combine the IP address and port number. This combination is known as a socket address.</blockquote>

<b>Example:</b> 192.168.1.1:80 (IP address + port 80, typically for HTTP server).
<br><br>
Both client and server have socket addresses to uniquely identify the communicating processes.

<h4>Port Number Categories</h4>
<ol>
<li>Well-known Ports (0–1023): Reserved for common services (e.g., HTTP on 80, FTP on 21, DNS on 53).</li>
<li>Registered Ports (1024–49151): Assigned to specific services by IANA but not tightly controlled.</li>
<li>Dynamic or Ephemeral Ports (49152–65535): Used temporarily by client processes when initiating communication.</li>
</ol>

Port Number Categories
Well-known Ports (0–1023): Reserved for common services (e.g., HTTP on 80, FTP on 21, DNS on 53).

Registered Ports (1024–49151): Assigned to specific services by IANA but not tightly controlled.

Dynamic or Ephemeral Ports (49152–65535): Used temporarily by client processes when initiating communication.

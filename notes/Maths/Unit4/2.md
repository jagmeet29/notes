# Graph 

A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent pairwise structure between objects.

> A graph $G = (V,E)$ consist of $V$ a non empty set of vertices (or nodes) and $E$ a set of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it called its endpoints. An edge is said to be connected  to its endpoints.

**Infinite graph** $\rightarrow$ A graph with infinite set of vertices and edges.

**Finite graph** $\rightarrow$ A graph with finite set of vertices and edges.

**Multigraph** $\rightarrow$ A graph where you are allowed to have more than one edge connecting the same pair of vertices. 

<small>Think of it like having multiple different roads (edges) directly connecting the same two towns (vertices).</small>

**Loop** $\rightarrow$ A loop in a graph is a edge that connects a vertex to itself (sometimes called <u>Self-loop</u>) 

**Pseudographs** $\rightarrow$ A graph which allows both loops and multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices. 

<small>In contract ot simple graph which allow one edges between two vertices and no loops.</small>

## Directed Graph 

> A directed graph (or diagram) $(V,E)$ consist of of a nonempty set of vertices $V$ and a set of directed edges (or arcs) $E$. Each directed edge is assigned with an  ordered pair of vertices. The directed edges associated with the ordered pair $(u,v)$ is said to $start$ at $u$ and $end$ at $v$.

# Graph 

A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent pairwise structure between objects.

> A graph $G = (V,E)$ consist of $V$ a non empty set of vertices (or nodes) and $E$ a set of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it called its endpoints. An edge is said to be connected  to its endpoints.

  <h1>Graph</h1>

<p>A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent pairwise structure between objects.</p>

<blockquote>
  A graph \( G = (V,E) \) consist of \( V \) a non empty set of vertices (or nodes) and \( E \) a set of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it called its endpoints. An edge is said to be connected  to its endpoints.
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Infinite graph</strong> &rarr; A graph with infinite set of vertices and edges.</p>

<p><strong>Finite graph</strong> &rarr; A graph with finite set of vertices and edges.</p>

<p><strong>Multigraph</strong> &rarr; A graph where you are allowed to have more than one edge connecting the same pair of vertices.</p>

<small>Think of it like having multiple different roads (edges) directly connecting the same two towns (vertices).</small>

<p><strong>Loop</strong> &rarr; A loop in a graph is a edge that connects a vertex to itself (sometimes called <u>Self-loop</u>)</p>

<p><strong>Pseudographs</strong> &rarr; A graph which allows both loops and multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices.</p>

<small>In contract to simple graph which allow one edge between two vertices and no loops.</small>

<h2>Directed Graph</h2>

<blockquote>
  A directed graph, or digraph, is a structure that not only shows connections between objects (vertices) but also captures the direction of those connections. In a directed graph, the structure is formally defined as a pair \( (V,E) \), where \( V \) is a nonempty set of vertices and \( E \) is a set of directed edges (or arcs).
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Simple Directed Graph</strong> &rarr; A directed graph having no loops and multiple directed edges.</p>

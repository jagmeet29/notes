  <h1>Graph</h1>

  <p>
    A graph is a mathematical structure used to represent pairwise structure
    between objects.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    A graph \( G = (V,E) \) consist of \( V \) a non empty set of vertices (or
    nodes) and \( E \) a set of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices
    associated with it called its endpoints. An edge is said to be connected to
    its endpoints.
  </blockquote>
  <a href="GraphTerm.html#one">Important Terms</a>
  <p>
    <strong>Infinite graph</strong> &rarr; A graph with infinite set of vertices
    and edges.


<br />
    <strong>Finite graph</strong> &rarr; A graph with finite set of vertices and
    edges.
  </p>

  <h2>Isomorphic Graph</h2>
  <blockquote>
    Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same "structure" even though they might appear different at first glance. Think of isomorphic graphs as twins wearing different clothes - they look different superficially but are fundamentally identical.
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Requirements: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      They must have the same number of vertices</li><li>

They must have the same number of edges</li><li>

Their degree sequences must match and there must be mapping of degree </li><li>

If vertices form a cycle of certain length in one graph, the corresponding vertices must form a cycle of the same length in the other graph
    </li>
    <li>There Adjacency Matrix must match</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Note: These conditions are necessary but not sufficient - meeting all these conditions doesn't guarantee the graphs are isomorphic, but failing any condition proves they are definitely not isomorphic.</p>
  <h2>Simple Graph</h2>
  <blockquote>
    A simple graph is a graph that does not contain any loops or multiple edges.
    In other words, each pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge, and
    no edge connects a vertex to itself.
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Multigraph</h2>
  <blockquote>
    A multigraph is a type of graph in which two vertices can be connected by
    more than one edge. These multiple edges between the same pair of vertices
    are called parallel edges or multiple edges
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Think of it like having multiple different roads (edges) directly connecting
    the same two towns (vertices).
  </p>
  <h2>Connected Graph</h2>
  <blockquote>
    A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path between every pair of
    vertices. In other words, you can reach any vertex from any other vertex by
    traversing the edges of the graph.
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Pseudograph</h2>
  <blockquote>
    A pseudograph is a graph that allows both loops and multiple edges. In a
    pseudograph, you can have edges that connect a vertex to itself (loops) as
    well as multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Directed Graph</h2>
  <blockquote>
    A directed graph, or digraph, is a structure that not only shows connections
    between objects (vertices) but also captures the direction of those
    connections. In a directed graph, the structure is formally defined as a
    pair \( (V,E) \), where \( V \) is a nonempty set of vertices and \( E \) is
    a set of directed edges (or arcs).

<h2>Regular Graph</h2>
<blockquote>A regular graph is a graph in which every vertex has the same number of edges connected to it. In other words, all vertices have the same degree (the degree is the number of edges incident to a vertex).</blockquote>
<h2>K-Regular Graph</h2>
<blockquote>A k-regular graph is a specific type of regular graph where every vertex has exactly k edges connected to it. In other words, the degree of each vertex in the graph is k.</blockquote>
<p>A complete graph with $n$ vertices is 
  $(n-1)$-regular, since each vertex connects to all other $n-1$ vertices.<br>  If $k$ is odd, the number of vertices $n$ must be even. (By <a href="Theorems.html">Handshaking Theorem</a>) <br>Number of edges $\rightarrow \frac {n \ \times \ k}{2}$ 
<br>For example, a 3-regular graph is a graph where every vertex has exactly 3 edges connected to it.</p>

<h1>Bipartite Graphs</h1>
<p>
  A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. In other words, there are no edges between vertices within the same set.
</p>
<blockquote> A simple graph $G$ is called bipartite if its vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two disjoint
  sets $V_1$ and $V_2$  such that every edge in the graph connects a vertex in $V_1$  and a vertex in $V_2$ 
  (so that no edge in $G$ connects either two vertices in V1 or two vertices in V2). When this
  condition holds, we call the pair $(V_1 ,V_2)$ a bipartition of the vertex set $V$ of $G$.</blockquote>

 <h5> The key insight is that in any cycle:</h5>

<li>Bipartite coloring works by alternating between the two sets as you move from vertex to vertex</li>

<li>For even cycles (like C_6), you make an even number of "color switches" when going around the cycle</li>

<li>For odd cycles (like C_3), you make an odd number of "color switches" when going around the cycle</li>

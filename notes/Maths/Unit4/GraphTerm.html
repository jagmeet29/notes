  <h1>Graph Terminology</h1>

  <h4>Adjacent Vertices (or Neighbors)</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If there is a edge $e$ that connects vertices $u$ and $v$, then $u$ and
      $v$ are said to adjacent.
    </li>
    <li>This simply means that $u$ and $v$ are directly connected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Incidence</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      When an edge $e$ connects both $u$ and $v$, we $e$ incident with $u$ and
      $v$.
    </li>
    <li>
      Being "incident" means that the edge touches or connects the respective
      vertices.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Neighborhood of a vertex</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The neighborhood of a vertex $v$ is written as $N(v)$, is simply the set
      of all vertices that are directly connected to $v$ by an edge.
    </li>
    <li>These vertices are called neighbors of $v$.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Example</h5>

  <p>
    $N(A) = \{B,C\}$ - A's neighbors are B and C<br />$N(B) = \{A,D\}$ - B's
    neighbors are A and D
  </p>

  <h4>Neighborhood of a set of vertices</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The neighborhood of a set of vertices is all the vertices that connect
      directly to at least one vertex in your set.
    </li>
    <li>
      Think of it this way: if you have a group of people, their collective
      neighborhood includes everyone who is friend with at lest one person in
      the group.
    </li>
    <li>
      $N(A) =$ the union of all the neighborhoods of individual vertices in A.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Example</h5>

  <p>$N(\{A,B\}) = \{A,B,C,D\}$</p>

  <h4>Degree of vertex</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>It is the number of edges incident on the vertex.</li>
    <li>Loop contributes twice to the degree of the vertex.</li>
    <li>The degree of the vertex is denoted by $deg(v)$.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Insolated vertx</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>It is a vertex of degree zero.</li>
    <li>It has no adjacent vertex.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Pendent</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>A vertex with degree one.</li>
    <li>It is adjacent to exactly one vertex.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directional Graph</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In a directional graph, the edges have a direction.</li>
    <li>The direction is indicated by an arrow.</li>
    <li>In a directional graph, the edges are called arcs.</li>

    <li>
      In a directional graph, the degree of a vertex is divided into two parts:
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In-degree $deg^-(v)$: the number of arcs directed towards the vertex.
      </li>
      <li>
        Out-degree $deg^+(v)$: the number of arcs directed away from the vertex.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Loop at a vertex contributes 1 to in-degree and 1 to out-degree.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="res-ques">
    <h3>Find the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex,</h3>
    <img src="2.png" />
    <button class="ans-button" style="margin: 10px auto">Show Answer</button>
    <div class="ans-content">
      <p>
        In-degree: a=2, b=2, c=3, d=2, e=3<br />Out-degree: a=4, b=1, c=2, d=2,
        e=3
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Adjacent Vertex in directed graph</h3>
  <p>
    In a graph $G$ having edge $(u,v)$. $u$ is said to be adjacent to $v$ and
    $v$ is said to be adjacent to $u$.
  </p>
  <h3>Initial & Terminating vertex</h3>
  
  <li>
    The vertex $u$ is called initial vertex of $(u,v)$ and $v$ is called the
    terminating vertex or end vertex of $(u,v)$.
  </li>

  <li>The initial and terminating vertex of loop are same.</li>
</div>

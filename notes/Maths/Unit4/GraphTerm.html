<h1>Graph Terminology </h1>

<h4>Adjacent Vertices (or Neighbors)</h4>

<ul><li>If there is a edge $e$ that connects vertices $u$ and $v$, then $u$ and $v$  are said to adjacent.</li><li>This simply means that $u$ and $v$ are directly connected.</li></ul>

<h4>Incidence</h4>

<ul><li>When an edge $e$ connects both $u$ and $v$, we $e$ incident with $u$ and $v$.</li><li>Being "incident" means that the edge touches or connects the respective vertices.</li></ul>

<h4>Neighborhood of a vertex</h4>

<p>The neighborhood of a vertex $v$ is written as $N(v)$, is simply the set of all vertices that are directly connected to $v$ by an edge. These vertices are called neighbors of $v$.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

$N(A) = \{B,C\}$ - A's neighbors are B and C

$N(B) = \{A,D\}$ - B's neighbors

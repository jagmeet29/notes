  <h4>Adjacent Vertices (or Neighbors)</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If there is a edge $e$ that connects vertices $u$ and $v$, then $u$ and
      $v$ are said to adjacent.
    </li>
    <li>This simply means that $u$ and $v$ are directly connected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Incidence</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      When an edge $e$ connects both $u$ and $v$, we $e$ incident with $u$ and
      $v$.
    </li>
    <li>
      Being "incident" means that the edge touches or connects the respective
      vertices.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Neighborhood of a vertex</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The neighborhood of a vertex $v$ is written as $N(v)$, is simply the set
      of all vertices that are directly connected to $v$ by an edge.
    </li>
    <li>These vertices are called neighbors of $v$.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Example</h5>

  <p>
    $N(A) = \{B,C\}$ - A's neighbors are B and C<br />$N(B) = \{A,D\}$ - B's
    neighbors are A and D
  </p>

  <h4>Neighborhood of a set of vertices</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The neighborhood of a set of vertices is all the vertices that connect
      directly to at least one vertex in your set.
    </li>
    <li>
      Think of it this way: if you have a group of people, their collective
      neighborhood includes everyone who is friend with at lest one person in
      the group.
    </li>
    <li>
      $N(A) =$ the union of all the neighborhoods of individual vertices in A.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Example</h5>

  <p>$N(\{A,B\}) = \{A,B,C,D\}$</p>

  <h4>Degree of vertex</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>It is the number of edges incident on the vertex.</li>
    <li>Loop contributes twice to the degree of the vertex.</li>
    <li>The degree of the vertex is denoted by $deg(v)$.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Insolated vertx</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>It is a vertex of degree zero.</li>
    <li>It has no adjacent vertex.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Pendent</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>A vertex with degree one.</li>
    <li>It is adjacent to exactly one vertex.</li>
  </ul>

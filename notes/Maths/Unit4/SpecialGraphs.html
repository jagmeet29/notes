      <h1>Special Graphs</h1>
      <h2>Complete Graph</h2>
      <blockquote>
        A complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted by $K_n$, is a simple graph
        that contains exactly one edge between each pair of distinct vertices.

      <p>
        The graphs $K_n$, for n =1,2,3,4,5,6, are as shown. A simple graph for
        which there is at least one pair of distinct vertex not connected by an
        edge is called non-complete.

      <h2>Cycles</h2>
      <blockquote>
        A Cycle $C_n$, $n>=3$, is a circuit in which no vertex is repeated

        A wheel graph $W_n$, $n>=4$, is a graph obtained by joining a single
        vertex to all vertices of a cycle.

<h1>Bipartite Graphs</h1>
<p>
    A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. In other words, there are no edges between vertices within the same set.
</p>
<blockquote> A simple graph $G$ is called bipartite if its vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two disjoint
    sets $V_1$ and $V_2$  such that every edge in the graph connects a vertex in $V_1$  and a vertex in $V_2$ 
    (so that no edge in $G$ connects either two vertices in V1 or two vertices in V2). When this
    condition holds, we call the pair $(V_1 ,V_2)$ a bipartition of the vertex set $V$ of $G$.</blockquote>

   <h5> The key insight is that in any cycle:</h5>

<li>Bipartite coloring works by alternating between the two sets as you move from vertex to vertex</li>

<li>For even cycles (like C_6), you make an even number of "color switches" when going around the cycle</li>

<li>For odd cycles (like C_3), you make an odd number of "color switches" when going around the cycle</li>

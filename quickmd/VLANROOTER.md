# Inter-VLAN Routing Explained

Inter-VLAN routing is the process of enabling communication between devices on different VLANs within the same network. Since VLANs are designed to isolate and segment network traffic, a Layer 3 device (router or Layer 3 switch) is required to allow traffic to flow between these separate network segments[1][4].

## Why We Need Inter-VLAN Routing

VLANs create isolated broadcast domains, which is great for security and performance, but presents a challenge when devices need to communicate across these boundaries. Inter-VLAN routing solves several problems:

- **Shared Resources**: Allows devices on different VLANs to access common resources like printers and servers[2][4]
- **Security**: Maintains network segmentation while allowing controlled communication between segments[4]
- **Scalability**: Supports network growth without requiring physical reconfiguration[4]
- **Traffic Management**: Provides control over how traffic flows between different network segments[4]

## Methods of Inter-VLAN Routing

There are three primary ways to implement Inter-VLAN routing:

### 1. Traditional/Legacy Inter-VLAN Routing
- Uses a router with multiple physical interfaces
- Each router interface connects to a switch port configured for a different VLAN
- Each interface acts as the default gateway for its VLAN[4][8]
- **Limitation**: Requires one physical interface per VLAN, making it expensive and unscalable[4]

### 2. Router-on-a-Stick
- Uses a single physical router interface connected to the switch via a trunk link
- Creates multiple subinterfaces on the router, each mapped to a different VLAN
- The trunk link carries traffic for all VLANs between switch and router[3][7]
- Suitable for small to medium networks[1]

### 3. Layer 3 Switch Inter-VLAN Routing
- Uses a switch with built-in routing capabilities
- Creates Switched Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) - virtual interfaces for each VLAN
- Routes packets between VLANs internally without external hardware[3][7]
- Most efficient and scalable solution for medium to large networks[1][6]
- Better performance as routing occurs in hardware instead of software[1]

## How Inter-VLAN Routing Works

When a device in one VLAN needs to communicate with a device in another VLAN:

1. Source device sends packet to its default gateway (router interface or SVI for that VLAN)
2. Router/Layer 3 switch receives the packet and examines the destination IP address
3. Router determines which VLAN the destination belongs to
4. Router forwards the packet to the destination VLAN
5. Destination device receives the packet[3]

## Implementing Router-on-a-Stick in Packet Tracer

To configure Router-on-a-Stick in Packet Tracer:

1. **Configure VLANs on the switch**
2. **Set up the trunk port** on the switch to connect to the router
3. **Create subinterfaces** on the router (one for each VLAN)
4. **Configure encapsulation** on each subinterface using the dot1Q protocol and appropriate VLAN ID
5. **Assign IP addresses** to each subinterface (these become the default gateways for devices in each VLAN)[5]

Would you like me to provide the specific commands for implementing any of these Inter-VLAN routing methods in more detail?
